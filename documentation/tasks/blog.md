# Task: Blog application

In this task you will be the architect of the backend for a blog application.

> Prerequisites:
> You need a working django project, see task [Start project](startproject.md).

## Step 1: Initialize application

Run a django command to start an app with the name `'blog'`.

Resource: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

To create app (from root of project on host machine):

```
docker compose exec clean pipenv run python manage.py startapp blog
```

</details>

<br>
<br>

## Step 2: Add app to project

Our new app is only a collection of files, they don't do very much at the moment.  
Django isn't aware of them yet.  
Tell your django project to add `blog` as an app.

Hint:
<br>
See `INSTALLED_APPS` in `root/settings.py`.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial02/#activating-models

```py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'blog', # <-- Add this.
]
```

</details>

<br>
<br>

## Step 3: Create model

Create a model for `BlogPost`.  
Be creative, identify fields you find relevant to a blogpost.  
To get you started -- you should probably have a `title`, and maybe an `author`.

Bonus:
You can create more models to achieve relations.

Resource: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/db/models/

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

> `blank`: Specifies if field can be blank when creating an instance.
> `null`: Specifies a database constraint field can be blank when creating an instance.

```py
# blog/models.py

from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=42, blank=True, null=True)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=42, blank=True, null=True)
    born = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        """
        Returns the string representation of an instance.
        We want to see the full name (strip whitespace if partially missing name)
        """
        return f'{self.last_name} {self.last_name}'.strip()


class Blog(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=False, null=True)
    text = models.TextField(blank=False, null=True)
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.PROTECT, blank=True, null=True)
    published = models.DateTimeField()
    hidden = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    last_updated = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    created = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        """
        Returns the string representation of an instance.
        We want to see the title.
        """
        return f'{self.title}'
```

## Step 4: Connect the Django admin site to the models
The admin site is an interface accessable to users with a username and pasword, that can be used to manage the content on the site. To log into the admin site and access all functionality you should have created a superuser in a previous step.

Resource: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/admin/ 
    
- mention something on the requrements added into INSTALLED_APPS when startproject is used?
    
First enter https://localhost:8001/admin/ and log in using the username and password you have defined. This will show the Django admin site/panel, but it does not contain any information on the models you have created yet. To connect the models you defined in blog/models.py registrer the models in blog/admin.py as described in the resource-link. 
    
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```py
# blog/admin.py
    
from django.contrib import admin
from blog.models import Author, BlogPost

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(Author)
admin.site.register(BlogPost)
```
</details>
    
After registering the models you can re-enter the admin site. It should now be possible to add an author or write a new blog post based on the models you created.

## Step 5: Create views for displaying content
    
In this section you will create views in order to display content. Views can be function-based or class-based, in this workshop the latter is used, and you can read more about the two approaches in the resource link. A view takes a web request and returns a web response, which for example can be the html content on your page.
    
Resource: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/views/

Write a view called Home that can be used to display some text of your choice. 
    
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
    
```py
# blog/views.py
    
from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpRequest
from django.views import View
from blog.models import BlogPost

# Create your views here.
    
class Home(View):
    template_name: str = 'blog/home.html'
    
    def get(self, request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
        return HttpResponse('Welcome to my blog!')
```   
</details>

<br>
<hr>
<br>
    
    
## Step 6: Mapping URLs to views
You now have a view that contains a http response which includes something you want to display. To display this view at a particular URL, youâ€™ll need to create a URLconf which is a mapping between URL path expressions and Python functions (your views). Use the given resources, as well as the comments in root/urls.py and blog/urls.py to map between the URLs and views. 
    
 Resource: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/urls/
 
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
    
```py
# blog/urls.py
from blog.views import Home
from django.urls import path

urlpatterns = [
    path('all/', Home.as_view(), name='home'),
] 
```
    
```py
# root/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('blog/', include('blog.urls')),
]

```
</details>

Now you can enter https://localhost:8001/blog/all/.
    
<br>
<hr>
<br>   
    
  
    
## Step 7: Display blog posts
To display the blog posts you have created in the admin panel instead of the text you chose in the previous step, the http response returned by the view has to to contain the blog posts.

Resource: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial03/ (go down to "Writing views that actually do something")
    
Change the view to return a html-response containing the blog posts. 
NB: Try using Type.objects.all() if you want to display all the blog posts, as objects.all() displays all the questions in the database.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
    
```py
# blog/views.py
    
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpRequest
from django.views import View
from blog.models import BlogPost

# Create your views here.
    
class Home(View):
    template_name: str = 'blog/home.html'

    def get(self, request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
        blog_posts = BlogPost.objects.all()
        return render(request, self.template_name, {'blog_posts': blog_posts})
```    
</details>

To display the blog posts on the url https://localhost:8001/blog/all/ create a new folder innside clean/blog called templates, and then create a new folder named blog innside the templates folder. Then create the file home.html, and present the blog posts from the view in the body of the html file.
NB: You can use the Django documentation to discover how to add the blog posts to the html file.
    
    
<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
    
```html
# blog/templates/blog/home.html
    
<!DOCTYPE html>
{% load static %}
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'blog/styles.css' %}" />
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Django blog</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div classname="header">
      <h1>Django Blog</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my super cool blog written in Django!</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      {% for blog_post in blog_posts %}
      <div>
        <h2>{{ blog_post.title }}</h2>
        <p>{{ blog_post.text }}</p>
      </div>
      {% endfor %}
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

```   
</details>

## Bonus 1: Modify behaviour on save

If an author has `last_name` equal to `'Nordmann'`, change it to `'Viking'`.

See this post:  
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/overriding-the-save-method-django-models/

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```py
# blog/models.py

from django.db import models

class Author(models.Model):
    ...

    def save(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:

        # Modify name.
        if self.last_name == 'Nordmann':
            self.last_name = 'Viking'

        # Proceed with saving.
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
```
