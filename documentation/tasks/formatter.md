# Task: Formatter

> This task requires that you have installed

In this task you will install and configure a formatter named `yapf` for your editor.
`yapf` only cares about whitespace, it will not modify any other characters.

There are several configurations, for example always two empty lines before a class declaration.

> This task is intended to be performed locally on your host machine, not inside docker container.
