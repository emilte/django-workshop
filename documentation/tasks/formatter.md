# Task: Formatter

In this task you will install and configure a formatter named `yapf` for your editor.
`yapf` only cares about whitespace, it will not modify any other characters.

You already have this setup configured in the root directory of this project (given that you completed the local setup in README). For this task, you can open a new window in VSCode from the folder `clean`. That way, you will start without any interpreter or vscode settings.

Yapf have several configurations, for example always two empty lines before a class declaration.

> This task is intended to be performed locally on your host machine, not inside docker container.
> The local setup from README is _required_ for this task.
