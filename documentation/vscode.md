## What is this?

The current README is designed for development directly inside a running container. This causes issues when the codebase is introduced with lines of code that the running container is unable to compile. You will be stuck in a loop of wanting to fix some code to get the project to compile, whilst being dependent on a working container to develop.

Instead, I propose a local development environment independent from Docker.

> Attaching directly to the container is still useful when you want to utilise the debug server.

## Files explained

Which folders and files are relevant to VScode, what do they mean, and which ones are recognised by VSCode.

- `.vscode/`  
  Folder recognized by VSCode. Contains configurations for workspace.

- `extensions.json`  
  Contains common extensions needed for this project.
  This file is recognised by VSCode, so hopefully it prompts you to install these automatically.

- `extensions.recommended.json`  
  Contains recommended optional extensions for this project.

- `launch.json`  
  Contains configurations for debugging.

- `settings.json`  
  Contains workspace settings for VSCode and extensions. Note that workspace settings takes precedens over user-settings.
  This file is recognised by VSCode and is to be configured to your liking. That's why this file is intentionally excluded from git.

- `settings.default.json`  
  Contains common project-specific settings shared between developers. These settings are project specific and intended to be used ba all team-members. Copy these settings into `settings.json`.

- `settings.suggestions.json`  
  Contains suggestions for useful settings, but not neccessary ones. Copy into `settings.json` if desired.

## Local setup

> Make sure you have downloaded a version of VSCode compatible with your device.  
> MAC: universal or M1.  
> Windows: ...  
> Linux: ...

### Virtual environment

The backend is a Django application, meaning we need to setup a python environment for VSCode.

Commands:

```sh
PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1 # Ensures folder `.venv` appears in project.
pyenv install # Install python version defined in `.python-version`.
python -m pip install pipenv # Install `pipenv`.
python -m pipenv install -r requirements-frozen.txt # Install dependencies.
python -m pipenv install -r requirements/development.txt # Install dependencies.

```

VSCode should now recognize the environment. If not, you have to manually select interpreter (hint: `CMD+Shift+P`).

<br>

### VSCode extensions

From project folder:

```sh
# Get default settings.
cp .vscode/settings.default.json .vscode/settings.json

```

- Install all extensions from `extensions.json`.
- Install desired extensions from `extensions.recommended.json`.
- Copy desired settings from `settings.suggestions.json` into `settings.json`.

## Extensions explained

This section motivates the multiple extensions relevant for this project.

<br>

### Default

List of extensions you should have in this project. Found in [`extensions.json`](/.vscode/extensions.json).

- `ms-python.python` [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)  
  This project uses Django as framework, which is python based. This extension includes neccessary python language support. It also includes `ms-python.vscode-pylance` [(link)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) which is the default language server for VSCode. A language server is able to lint in realtime unlike pylint. It also enables helper/suggestion pallette when developing. `visualstudioexptteam.vscodeintellicode` [(link)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioexptteam.vscodeintellicode).

- `batisteo.vscode-django`
  [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=batisteo.vscode-django)  
  Supports Django syntax in templates (.html) and useful snippets.

- `esbenp.prettier-vscode` [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)  
  Prettier is a formatting tool for frontend configured in this project (see [`prettierrc.js`](/.prettierrc.js)). This extension

- `editorconfig.editorconfig`
  [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=editorconfig.editorconfig)  
  [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) configures consistent coding styles across various editors and filetypes.

- `visualstudioexptteam.vscodeintellicode` [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=visualstudioexptteam.vscodeintellicode)  
  Used in conjunction with `pylance` to enable smart suggestions during development.

### Recommended

Optional (nice-to-have) extensions for development. They can be found in [`extensions.recommended.json`](/.vscode/extensions.recommended.json).

- `mikestead.dotenv` [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mikestead.dotenv)  
  Environment-files (.env) have no highlighting by default. This extension fixes that.

- `ms-azuretools.vscode-docker` [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)  
  This project is setup with container-technology with Docker. This extensions integrates Docker functionality.

- `ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers` [link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)  
  Enables VSCode to attach to a running container. Useful for debugging and developing without having to install any dependencies locally.
